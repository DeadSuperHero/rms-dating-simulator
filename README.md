# Richard Stallman Dating Simulator
A visual novel involving __Richard Stallman__ (also known as RMS) of the
__Free Software Foundation__ as well as the __GNU__ project.
This is inspired by numerous dating simulator games found in the
Newgrounds.com community.

Core story loop is under development. Milestones for features and plot elements
are currently being explored.


## How to run the game
Since it is early development, no binaries or packages are being provided.
Instead, you will need to actually install Ren'Py and git clone this repo into
your Ren'Py Projects Directory.

You can specify this location in your Ren'Py settings;
for convenience mine is `/home/Sean/Workspace/Python/`. Any directory present
in that folder would see the new Ren'Py game you've added to it.



## FAQ
### Why Richard Stallman?
Why not? RMS is a quirky person, who also deserves to be loved. This game
exists as a byproduct of Rule 34, in the context that if something online can be
imagined, it can exist.
### Is this game Free software?
Yes, the engine is LGPL, and the visual novel itself is GPLv3. All art assets are
considered to be __Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0__
### Does RMS know about this game?
Probably not. The real issue, I believe, is that I have no idea on how to make
instructions for playing this in Emacs.
### Can I get involved with this somehow?
Sure! Just open up a Pull Request.
### Will you provide binaries or packages in the future?
Possibly, but it isn't yet a high priority. If this hits a level of polish
that demands a wider audience of people plays it, then I'll put something together.
