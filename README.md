## FAQ
### Why Richard Stallman?
Why not? RMS is a quirky person, who also deserves to be loved. This game
exists as a byproduct of Rule 34, in the context that if something online can be
imagined, it can exist.
### Is this game Free software?
Yes, the engine is LGPL, and the visual novel itself is GPLv3. All art assets are
considered to be __Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0__
### Does RMS know about this game?
Probably not. The real issue, I believe, is that I have no idea on how to make
instructions for playing this in Emacs.
### Can I get involved with this somehow?
Sure! Just open up a Pull Request.
